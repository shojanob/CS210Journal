# Inventory Management System
Project Summary
The Inventory Management System is designed to manage a set of items in an inventory, allowing users to add, view, update, and delete items in the system. The goal of this project is to address the common problem of manually managing inventory records, which can be a hassle and vulnerable to errors. By developing this application, the system ensures accurate tracking of inventory data, making it easier for users to manage their resources effectively.

What I Did Well
One of the strong factors of this project is the user interface provided through the console. The project's UI makes it easy for users to navigate and perform operations without requiring extra knowledge. I also ensured that the code is modular and easy to read, with each function handling a specific task/action, which makes the program easier to debug and extend in the future.

Areas for Enhancement
While the current system is functional and usable, there are definetely several factors where the code could be improved. For example, a good approach would be adding file handling capabilities, which would allow the system to save and load inventory data, making the application more practical for real-world use, especially with CSV and Excel files. Additionally, implementing error handling and input validation would enhance the security and robustness of the code, preventing common user errors such as entering invalid data types.

Potential Enhancements:
File Handling: Persist inventory data between sessions by saving to and loading from a file.
Error Handling: Implement try-catch blocks and input validation to prevent crashes due to incorrect input.
Optimization: Improve the search and update functions by implementing more efficient data structures like hash maps.
Challenges and Solutions
One of the more challenging aspects of this project was ensuring that the program handles dynamic memory management correctly, especially when dealing with the dynamic changes of addition, updating, and deletion of items in the inventory. I overcame this challenge by carefully managing the enhancement of objects and using the vector data structure, which simplifies dynamic memory management in C++. Additionally, ensuring that the programâ€™s logic was both enhanced and easy to follow required careful planning and testing of each function on their own before integrating them into the main system.

Transferable Skills
This project helped me strengthen several key programming skills that will be highly transferable to other projects. For instance, I gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented programming, particularly in designing and managing classes and objects. The experience of handling user input, managing data dynamically, and ensuring that the program is both functional and user-friendly will also be beneficial in future projects.

Maintainability, Readability, and Adaptability
I aimed to make this program as maintainable and adaptable as possible. To achieve this, I followed best practices such as writing clear, self-explanatory code and using descriptive variable names. Functions were designed to be job-specific, each handling a specific aspect of the system's operation, which not only makes the code easier to read but also simplifies the process of adding new features or modifying existing ones.
